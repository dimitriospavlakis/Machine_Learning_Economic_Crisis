# Machine Learning, Feature Engineering, and EDA for Economic Crises in Africa

This python project provides a comprehensive overview on how to perform data modelling, feature engineering, predictor selection and machine learning (SVMs and Log Regr) using economic data across 13 African countries between 1840 and 2014.

The baseline code was obtained from Kaggle.
