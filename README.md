# Machine Learning, Feature Engineering, and EDA for Economic Crises

This python project provides a comprehensive overview on how to perform data modelling, feature engineering, predictor selection and machine learning using economic data across 13 African countries between 1840 and 2014.

Two key algorithms were found to be superior for the ML and analysis of this dataset: Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression.

It offers step by step instructions and extensive guidance for the reasoning behind every data modelling decision.
